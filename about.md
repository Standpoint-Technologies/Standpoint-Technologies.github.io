## Our Company
Standpoint Technologies was founded in 2000 by Jeff Carter and Gary Herron. They shared a vision to create technology to simplify and lower the cost of building web-based business applications. This goal was achieved with the creation of VersaIT, a rapid application development and hosting platform.

## What We Do
Every day, businesses face the classic “buy versus build” dilemma when they consider their options for information solutions. Many times, these businesses compromise on functionality and agility in order to avoid the time, costs, complexities, and risks associated with custom solutions. Standpoint Technologies has an approach and a set of services that dramatically reduce the disadvantages of custom solutions while retaining the functionality and agility benefits. With our approach you no longer compromise or change the business processes that are proven and differentiate you from your competitors. Your information solution supports your business rather than your business supporting your information solution.
