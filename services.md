## Versatile Applications and Products
Our customers use versatile applications and products created by Standpoint Technologies to enable them to take advantage of a powerful capability of the Web: managing and sharing business enhancing information.  These organizations gain a tremendous advantage from this strategic use of the Web, and also from the versatility built into each application or product created by Standpoint Technologies.

Standpoint Technologies' applications and products are built upon a software platform called VersaIT, which was created by Standpoint, and serves as both a rapid application development tool and a robust application server.  VersaIT-based systems inherit their versatility from the VersaIT software platform.

## Versatile Application Development
Using the VersaIT platform, Standpoint Technologies constructs custom business applications that address critical needs for organizations.  Examples of applications delivered include telemarketing, collections, collections accounting, and training content subscription management.  These applications are highly robust, scalable, flexible, and custom, but are a fraction of the cost of standard custom developed applications.  

## Versatile Product Development
The lower development costs coupled with the higher degree of functionality, security, and flexibility found in VersaIT-based systems make this an excellent choice for building web-based products.  Standpoint Technologies builds and supports products that are owned and sold by our customers, and products that we own and sell.  See the VersaIT-based Product Library for examples of products built by Standpoint Technologies using VersaIT.
